# ML-and-NLP-with-Pandas

This project aims to implement and tackle the following tasks using Python and Pandas library.

i. Decision trees with categorical attributes

ii. Cluster analysis

iii. Mining text data

# Dataset
Part 1 uses the “Adult” dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult).

Part 2 uses the “Wholesale Customers” dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wholesale+customers).

Part 3 uses the “Coronavirus Tweets NLP” dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datatattle/covid-19-nlp-text-classification).

# How to run the files
The files are in ipynb format. You can run them in Jupyter Notebook or any other notebook that supports this format. The first section of all three files consists of the main chunck of code. And the second part consists of print statements to to run, visualise and evaluate the main code chunk. Feel free to comment out any of the lines/tests to test individual functions.
